        "description": "Hi, thanks for landing here! This channel was previously known as 'Phenomenal Travel Videos'. I am Praveen Mohan and I like to travel to ancient sites around the world. My subscribers are awesome and they have helped me appear on TV shows (yes, Ancient Aliens on History Channel also) , magazines, podcasts, etc, etc. I am deeply interested in Ancient Technology and specifically love to research ancient Hindu temples. I appreciate your support for helping me unlock the secret science hidden in temples of India. I love exploring the concepts of Ancient Machining, Vimanas, UFO, extraterrestrials, and recreating the wisdom of our ancestors. Thank you for watching my videos and have a great day!",
